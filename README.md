# Getting Started
This is the server part of a little project developed by the Educem group Asix2x3 in .NET class named Socket Ball Game. You can play with
balls between your friends in the same local network using to Sockets and also thanks to the nodeJS Server that implemented socket.IO 
that manages all the clients connected.

# Examples about socket.io
To see some little examples about how it works socket.io in the server side and in the client side, you can see the code in the directory test/projects, there you could see a client example made it with C# and the most important a server example made it in nodeJS.
